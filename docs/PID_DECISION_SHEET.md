# PID decision sheet — answer these

**P0 status:** answered 2026-09-09 and locked in [`PID.md`](PID.md).  
**P1 status:** not answered by owner; PRD records **proposed defaults** for review.  
**P2 status:** unanswered (deferred).

## Owner answers (P0)

| ID | Answer |
|----|--------|
| Q1 | Electrical Engineer (repo `Electrical-Engineer`; CLI default `electrical-engineer`) |
| Q2 | India first; must not lack globally |
| Q3 | Apache License 2.0 (owner said 2.2; 2.0 is the current Apache licence, confirmed) |
| Q4 | Local-first CLI; also Cursor / Claude Code / OpenAI; BYO API key; local models |
| Q5 | Forever OSS; no paid product in this repo |
| Q6 | Thesis rewritten (see PID §1) |
| Q7 | Not GATE-bounded; GATE is an eval check; bound = UG courses at multiple Indian and global institutes |
| Q8 | PG not a public promise |
| Q9 | One repo only |
| Q10 | Civil / mechanical never |
| Q-H | **H3** (branded CLI wrapping portable H1 core) |
| Q-H2 | Yes — policy in CLI + skills (not a Pi fork constitution) |
| Q-H3 | N/A (not H4) |
| Q-H4 | N/A for v1 (H3; Cursor/Claude/OpenAI are first-class hosts) |
| Q-S | CLI **and** existing coding harnesses (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI) |
| Q-S2 | Yes — student need not use Cursor |
| Q-S3 | `electrical-engineer` |
| Q-R1 | B — label unchecked |
| Q-R2 | A — co-solver |
| Q-R3 | A — no faculty features in v1 |
| Q-R4 | Exam-style items in-scope; **git will not commit third-party copyrighted PDFs**; BYO allowed (legal policy in PRD) |

## P1 proposed defaults (owner may override at PRD review)

| ID | Proposed |
|----|----------|
| Q-V1 / Q-V2 | MATLAB if present; OSS first-class; design for mixed licences |
| Q-K1 | Local RAG (BYO PDFs; no commercial books in git) |
| Q-C | C1–C3 + C6–C7 in first slice; C4 P1; C5 after C4 |
| Q-D1 | Circuits first, then control |
| Q-E3 | Same repo, PG unpublished (not a second fork) |
| Q-N2 | A — no civil/mechanical packs |

Original questions follow for traceability.

Reply in chat by ID (example: `Q1 = B`, `Q-H = H4`, comments after).  
**P0** = do not lock the PID without this. **P1** = needed before v1 code. **P2** = can wait.

Skip is allowed: write `skip — reason`. Do not leave P0 blank if you want an Accepted PID.

Legend for harness (same as `PID.md` §6):

- **H1** Portable skills + MCP + local RAG (no owned harness)
- **H2** H1 + optional Pi package
- **H3** Branded CLI wrapping H1 (not a full unique harness)
- **H4** Electric Pi — hard fork of Pi, EE constitution in the harness
- **H5** Greenfield harness from zero

## How I will use your answers

1. Fill OPEN rows in `PID.md`.  
2. Mark harness H* as **Accepted** (or a stated hybrid).  
3. Shrink v1 to the slice you picked.  
4. Only then write the execution plan (nawab / Spec Kit if you chose Q-X11).  
5. I will **not** start product code until you accept that plan.

If you want to answer in batches, do **all P0 first**. That is enough for a second PID revision.

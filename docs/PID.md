# Product Identity Document (PID) — Electrical Engineer

**Status:** Proposed (2026-09-12). Aligns with Proposed [`PRD.md`](PRD.md). Previous Accepted P0 (2026-09-09) stands until the owner Accepts this revision.  
**Date:** 2026-09-12  
**Requirements authority after this:** [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) (Proposed)  
**How it is built:** [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)

H3, Apache-2.0, UG vs PG, one repo, and the exact token `unchecked` are **not** reopened. Category, host list, and “who writes the viva” are.

---

## 1. Thesis

Electrical Engineer is an Apache-2.0, forever-open-source undergraduate electrical-engineering **lab**: a **domain kernel** that wraps a rented frontier agent loop (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT desktop) so the student gets a checked assignment without us becoming a new harness. A branded **local CLI** plus a **persistent localhost UI** are a complete path with no AI host. Named **workflows** attach physics; they are not the chat brain. The product checks numbers with simulators when it can and labels unverified numbers with the exact token **unchecked**. It is shaped by **real UG coursework** at Indian and global institutes. GATE is an eval instrument, not the product bound. PG, civil, and mechanical are out of the public promise.

## 2. Identity (Proposed)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Public name | Electrical Engineer |
| GitHub repo | `Electrical-Engineer` |
| CLI (default) | `electrical-engineer` |
| Public category | Undergraduate electrical-engineering **lab** |
| Internal class | **domain kernel** (host owns the loop; we own engines, skills, gates) |
| Mode | Co-solver (full working + answer + evidence, or exact token `unchecked`) |
| Geography | India first; must not be weak for global UG EE |
| Licence (our code) | Apache License 2.0 |
| Commercial | Forever OSS in this repo; no paid tier |
| Locality | Local-first CLI + persistent UI on `127.0.0.1`; optional Cursor / Claude Code / Codex / ChatGPT desktop; BYO API key; local models |
| Harness | **H3** — branded CLI wrapping portable skills + MCP + local RAG. Deterministic YAML workflow runner as physics/eval backbone. Hosts own the inner loop and the viva. Not a Pi fork (H4). Not a greenfield harness (H5). |
| Surfaces | CLI `electrical-engineer`, stdio MCP, **persistent localhost UI** |
| Hosts (first-class) | Cursor; Claude Code; Codex (CLI / IDE / desktop Codex view); ChatGPT desktop Chat/Work (**contract**, weaker editor). ChatGPT **web**/mobile are not hosts. |
| Workflows | Named recipes; host picks the id when a host is present; CLI-without-host may classify; unmatched co-solver; does not invent a new graph |
| Repo copies | **One repo only** |
| Unverified numbers | Exact token **unchecked**; never presented as simulation; EE kernel is the only checked-number authority |
| Faculty / TA | None in v1 |
| PG | Not a public promise |
| Civil / mechanical / manufacturing | Never in this product |

**Is:** a student-facing, open, checkable UG electrical-engineering **lab** (domain kernel) with named workflows, simulators, tagged local RAG, and a persistent local UI so the student and the host agent can **see** the work.  
**Is not:** Siemens Eigen, MATLAB Copilot, Cadence Cerebrus, a plant-floor controller, a faculty LMS, a GATE-only drill app, a general coding agent with “also do circuits,” a video studio, or a unique agent harness that hosts cannot share.  
**Invariant:** EE tools own checked numbers; unverified numbers use the exact token **unchecked**; diagrams are drafts until the student confirms in the UI; no commercial textbooks in git; peer MATLAB MCP cannot mint checked numbers.

Rejected public nickname: “Agentic UG EE Studio”. “Bench” is not the public noun.

## 3. Who it is for

**Primary:** UG electrical engineering students — India first, including colleges without a MATLAB-fluent TA — who have assignments, labs, and diagrams in circuits, machines, power, control, signals, and electronics. Global UG EE remains first-class.

**In v1 as users, not extra products:** GATE/IES aspirants (exam-style; eval + BYO). Self-learners on UG-equivalent courses.

**Not in v1:** faculty/TA features, PG promise, working plant engineers, civil/mechanical students.

**Never:** control-room operators, live PLC writes, tape-out analog as the product identity.

## 4. Bound: UG coursework, not GATE

Public promise = **union of representative UG EE programmes** (Indian institutes + global institutes). See [`curriculum-map.md`](curriculum-map.md). GATE EE is an **eval overlay**, not the ceiling. Expansion stays in this repo via packs — never a second git repo. v1 **enabled** pack depth may be thinner than the bound ([`PRD.md`](PRD.md) §8).

## 5. Success bar (C1–C8)

Same IDs as `README.md`. Claimable bar: on a published UG task set, with tools on, match gold **or label unchecked**. Fluent wrong numbers presented as checked fail the product. v1 vs later is in the PRD.

## 6. H3 shape (Proposed)

```text
Student
  ├─ electrical-engineer CLI   (named workflows, gates, eval, rag inventory)
  ├─ persistent localhost UI   (127.0.0.1; shared understanding)
  └─ Cursor / Claude Code / Codex / ChatGPT desktop
           │
     skills + MCP (5–7 target verbs; as-built: list + run_workflow)
           │
     models: host subscription | BYO API key | local LLM
           │
     verifiers: OSS first-class; MATLAB if present through EE
```

Four layers: (0) rented host harness, (1) attach, (2) domain kernel, (3) UI + two-band artifacts. Detail: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md), [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) §5–§6.

The CLI is a **thin wrapper**: glue, ug profile, co-solver defaults, a **deterministic YAML DAG runner**, eval, and the local UI. It must not grow into a unique agent loop (H5). Hosts keep their own loops and write the viva.

## 7. Trust (locked)

| Topic | Stance |
|-------|--------|
| Unverified numbers | Exact token **unchecked** in the answer and in the evidentiary band; never call them simulation |
| Diagrams | Draft until the student confirms in the persistent UI |
| Integrity | Co-solver default; institution owns cheating policy; no faculty mode in v1 |
| Student data | Local by default; no silent upload |
| Plant / PLC write | Out of product |
| Copyright | No commercial PDFs in git; BYO or licensed embedding packs |
| Exam items | Exam-style tasks in-scope; **no** third-party copyrighted PDFs committed; BYO allowed |
| Peer MATLAB MCP | Untrusted until an EE engine recomputes |

## 8. Non-goals

- H4 (Electric Pi fork) and H5 (greenfield harness)
- Second git repo / UG-freeze fork
- PG as a public promise
- Civil, mechanical, manufacturing
- Faculty LMS, paid product, plant-floor copilots
- Replacing MATLAB or KiCad
- Shipping copyrighted textbooks or live exam PDFs in git
- ChatGPT web/mobile, Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI as v1 hosts

## 9. P1 proposed (not a P0 lock)

| Topic | Proposed |
|-------|----------|
| MATLAB vs OSS | MATLAB if present (EE node and/or peer MCP); OSS first-class otherwise; **product works without MATLAB** |
| RAG | Local store; BYO PDFs and scans; inventory + book/chapter/folder tags; no commercial books in git |
| Persistent UI | First-class local workspace (`electrical-engineer ui`) |
| v1 slice | C1–C3, C6–C7 plus UI + eval layout; C4 photo stub; C5 after C4 |
| First pack | Circuits first, then control ([`WORKFLOWS.md`](WORKFLOWS.md)) |
| Host ACI | 5–7 verbs; `run_workflow` = headless/eval rollback ([`PRD.md`](PRD.md) FR17) |

Overall confidence that **lab / domain kernel / ChatGPT desktop** match owner intake: high, pending owner Accept of this Proposed PID.

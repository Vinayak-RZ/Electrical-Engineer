# OpenAI / Codex

First-class host: Codex CLI, Codex IDE extension, and the **Codex view**
inside the ChatGPT desktop app. Same kernel contract as Cursor and Claude Code.

ChatGPT desktop **Chat / Work** is documented in [`chatgpt-desktop.md`](chatgpt-desktop.md).
ChatGPT **web** is **not** a host.

1. Configure MCP in `~/.codex/config.toml` (shared with ChatGPT desktop):

   ```toml
   [mcp_servers.electrical_engineer]
   command = "electrical-engineer"
   args = ["mcp"]
   ```

   Or Codex’s MCP add command, equivalent stdio.

2. Reuse the same `skills/` markdown (Codex skills path / `$skill`). Do not
   vendor a second recipe catalog.

3. Local OpenAI-compatible daemons are `EE_LOCAL_LLM_URL` on the **CLI** path
   only. This host uses its own loop.

4. Completeness of v1 **does** require documenting this host; it does **not**
   require every student to subscribe to Codex. CLI + UI remains complete.

5. As-built tools: `list_workflows`, `run_workflow` (never waits). Target:
   [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) FR17.

6. Peer MATLAB MCP: FR20.

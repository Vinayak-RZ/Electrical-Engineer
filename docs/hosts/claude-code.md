# Claude Code

First-class host. Same kernel contract as Cursor, Codex, and ChatGPT desktop.

1. Point Claude Code MCP at stdio command `electrical-engineer mcp`
   (user `~/.claude.json` or project `.mcp.json`).
2. Attach `skills/<pack>/SKILL.md` as project or user skills. Load the pack
   that matches the assignment; do not dump every pack into always-on context.
3. Use fully qualified tool names when several MCP servers are present
   (`electrical-engineer:list_workflows`).
4. `run_workflow` never blocks on a human gate. Use the localhost UI for
   confirm. Target split ACI: [`../PRD.md`](../PRD.md) FR17.
5. Host-native subagents (Task) may call the same EE MCP. We do not ship a
   custom multi-agent runtime (FR19).
6. Claude Code is optional. The CLI works without it.
7. Peer MATLAB MCP: FR20 — EE owns checked numbers.

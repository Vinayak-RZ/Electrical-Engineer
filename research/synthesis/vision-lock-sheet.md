# Vision lock sheet (WS-G)

## Purpose

Owner accept/reject for class, names, orchestrator split, and layering.

**2026-09-12:** D14–D17 are written into **Proposed** [`docs/PRD.md`](../../docs/PRD.md), [`docs/PID.md`](../../docs/PID.md), and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Owner checkboxes below stay empty until you Accept. Root `README.md` is **not** rewritten this pass.

## Findings

Claim | Evidence | Confidence
--- | --- | ---
Research recommends: keep product name Electrical Engineer; public category **lab**; internal class **domain kernel**; topology **C** plus CLI-inner/MCP-outer layering | `synthesis/domain-system-recommendation.md`; `notes/domain-kernel-layering.md` | high
H3, UG bound, `unchecked`, co-solver mode, student-without-Cursor, Apache-2.0, no plant-floor stay frozen even if this sheet is accepted | `docs/PID.md` | high

### Frozen (do not reopen here)

- H3 branded CLI wrapping portable skills + MCP; not H4; not H5
- Licence Apache-2.0; forever OSS in this repo
- UG coursework bound; GATE is eval overlay; PG not a public promise
- Exact token `unchecked`; co-solver default; no faculty v1
- Student need not use Cursor (CLI + localhost UI)
- Civil / mechanical / plant-floor / second git repo: never
- YAML runner as deterministic backbone (D13); no crash-resume

### Proposed (accept or reject)

**D14 Product name**

- Keep **Electrical Engineer** (repo `Electrical-Engineer`, CLI `electrical-engineer`).
- [ ] Accept
- [ ] Reject — write the alternative here only after a new naming note

Written into Proposed PID/PRD 2026-09-12 (not owner-Accepted).

**D15 Category noun**

- Public: **lab** (undergraduate electrical-engineering lab).
- Internal: **domain kernel** (harness-native; same class as OpenMontage).
- Mode: co-solver (unchanged).
- Named reject: “Agentic UG EE Studio”.
- Analog: turn your AI coding assistant into an undergraduate electrical-engineering lab.
- [ ] Accept
- [ ] Reject

Written into Proposed PID/PRD 2026-09-12 (not owner-Accepted).

**D16 Orchestrator split**

- Topology C: host agent orchestrates the *work*; Python owns verifiers, gates, eval, UI.
- Router still never invents a spice DAG. Unmatched never auto-simulates.
- Does not reopen H5. Does not drop the YAML runner.
- [ ] Accept
- [ ] Reject (A markdown control plane / B YAML-as-brain)

Written into Proposed PID/PRD/ARCHITECTURE 2026-09-12 (not owner-Accepted).

**D17 Domain-kernel layering**

- Four layers: (0) rented host harness, (1) attach (CLI inner, MCP outer; Chat/Work pin until Skills-over-MCP), (2) domain kernel, (3) UI + two-band artifacts.
- Spend the host on method, viva, student interview. Clamp numbers, invented spice DAGs, photo confirm, and `unchecked` in code.
- Host-path ACI: 5–7 verbs; mega `run_workflow` that includes `solve-explain` is headless/eval rollback, not the only chat path.
- Dual MATLAB MCP allowed; EE is the only checked-number authority.
- Steal no-bypass writes from executive kernels. Do not steal their loop (H5). Do not steal studio timeline UI.
- [ ] Accept
- [ ] Reject

Written into Proposed PRD FR17–FR22 / ARCHITECTURE §2 2026-09-12 (not owner-Accepted).

### Later docs pass

**Done as Proposed (2026-09-12), not Accepted:** PID category/hosts, PRD thesis + agent interaction, ARCHITECTURE four-layer map.

**Still waiting on owner Accept:** checkboxes above; then root `README.md` (product-readme) and `DECISIONS.md` ADR.

Would not change until a **code** plan: runner, CLI binary name, skill-pack rewrite, PyPI, HTTP MCP, MCP verb split implementation.

### Stop line

Owner checkboxes above are empty on purpose. Root README is unchanged until you Accept. This pass did not ship MCP verb splits or skill rewrites in Python.

## Open questions

- Spoken alias “EE lab” in the README subtitle (naming note default: yes, as subtitle only).

## Confidence

Overall confidence for this sheet: high

The recommendations are sourced. The checkboxes are the owner decision; empty boxes are intentional, not unfinished tokens.

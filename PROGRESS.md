## Assumptions

- CP-1: No commercial PDFs in git; BYO + licence-clean reconstructions; exam-style items in-scope without committing third-party papers.
- CP-2: MATLAB if present; OSS first-class. Entire product must work without MATLAB.
- Phase S cancelled until explicitly approved.
- Research `recommendation.md` O1/H2 is historical advice; product harness is H3.
- Architecture Q&A answers shape the accepted docs and the PRD FRs.

## Refinement log

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-09-08 | Local-first package + GitHub embedding packs (Chroma) + photo→schematic→Simulink research notes; Q16–Q17, D9–D10 |
| 2026-09-08 | RAG-Anything evaluation + ADR-0004; D11 multimodal ingest engine |
| 2026-09-08 | AI-in-core-engineering landscape + README success-bar capabilities; Q18, D12, ADR-0005 seed |
| 2026-09-09 | Draft PID + decision sheet; harness H1–H5 left OPEN for owner |
| 2026-09-09 | P0 locks accepted: H3 CLI, Apache-2.0, UG coursework bound, co-solver, label-unchecked, one repo |
| 2026-09-09 | PRD written; ADRs 0001/0005/0006 accepted; README identity aligned |
| 2026-09-10 | Proposed architecture: YAML DAG runner, persistent localhost UI, tagged RAG, markdown memory, `eval/gold/` |
| 2026-09-10 | PID/PRD/README upgraded to that architecture (exact `unchecked`, named workflows, UI, FR10–FR16) |
| 2026-09-10 | Vendored `cursor-config-coding` @ `280dbc5` (nawab lite default, Spec Kit v1.0.6, opt-in graph-engineering) |
| 2026-09-10 | Gate 0 research for product nawab+graph plan; compile blocked on owner answers |
| 2026-09-10 | Compiled nawab project plan + execution graph + 25 node plans; Gate 0 closed |
| 2026-09-10 | DESIGN-coinbase locked as UI visual system; ADR-0008 seeded; Wave 0 waits on owner start |
| 2026-09-10 | Owner start: D0+A1 executed; Spec Kit scaffolded; product `src/` begins Wave 1 |

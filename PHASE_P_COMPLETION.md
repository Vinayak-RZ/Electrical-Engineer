# Phase P completion — Accepted PID + PRD draft

## Gate

Identity locked. PRD complete and waiting on owner accept. Validator run is recorded in PROGRESS after `--full`.

## Completed

- PID status **Accepted** with P0 locks (H3, Apache-2.0, UG coursework bound, co-solver, label-unchecked, one repo).
- Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`.
- UG curriculum map (Indian + global institutes); GATE marked eval overlay only.
- `docs/PRD.md` sections 1–11 including P1 checkboxes and owner-review checkpoint.
- ADRs 0001, 0005, 0006 accepted; ADR-0003 notes label-unchecked.
- README / OVERVIEW / EXTENSIVE / PROGRESS / IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN current-contract aligned. No shipped-agent claim.

## Files modified (this phase)

`docs/PID.md`, `docs/PID_DECISION_SHEET.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/curriculum-map.md`, `LICENSE`, `DECISIONS.md`, `README.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/EXTENSIVE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, this file.

## Architectural changes

None in code. Product architecture **specified** as H3 (CLI wrapping portable skills + MCP). Research O1/H2 remains historical advice.

## Validation

`./scripts/research/validate-research.sh --full` → **PASS** (2026-09-09). README still has extensive banner + Future advancements; no product-landing bait. Research notes still have Sources/Confidence and no TODO/TBD/FIXME placeholders.

## Outstanding issues

- Owner has **not** said “PRD accepted”. P1 MATLAB/RAG/v1-slice/first-pack remain proposed.
- No CLI, MCP, or gold-task set in tree (intentional).

## Next phase

Owner accepts or edits the PRD. Then a **new implementation** nawab plan for the H3 CLI scaffold. No Spec Kit `.specify/` until that plan.

## What you learned

- Research option scores are not product locks: O1 won the memo; the owner chose H3.
- GATE as an eval overlay keeps Indian exam coverage without shrinking the syllabus to GATE weights.
- Labelling unverified numbers is a smaller, more honest policy than hard-refuse for a student co-solver.
